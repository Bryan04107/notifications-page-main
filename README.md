## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- VSC
- Classes

### What I learned

I learned the use of root and using it to create your own color variables, along with that, i also learnt how to change the cursor to a pointer when hovering over.

### Continued development

I would like to develop the speed at which I could create HTML and to improve on being more fluent in it as currently there is slight hiccups when making this HTML as there were some confusing aspects to it


### Useful resources

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:root - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand root. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept and other general concepts.
